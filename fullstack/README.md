# Full-stack reference applications

Three independent applications:

- **Finance:** Vue interface and FastAPI/SQLite backend. Start `uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` from its backend folder after installing the shared Python requirements. In its frontend folder, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm dev`. The interface can sign synthetic callbacks, review exceptions, propose adjustments and inspect audit state.
- **Commerce:** Next.js/React with Node route handlers. From its project folder, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm dev`, or `pnpm build` and `pnpm start`. Includes local reservations, cancellation, shipment, refund state transitions, outbox retries and role checks.
- **Education:** Angular interface with NestJS backend. Start the shared TypeScript API with this project's `project.json` and run the Angular client on its Vite port. Deterministic assessments, explicit instructor feedback review, versioned publication and audit views.

Backend implementations are shared with the corresponding language demos to prevent business-rule drift. The packaged repository includes those dependencies and frontends. SQLite or in-memory fixture state is used locally. PostgreSQL/Prisma, MongoDB/GraphQL, Redis, Kafka, AWS, Kubernetes and external model services are not configured in these demonstrations. No production authentication or cloud deployment is implied. Only synthetic data is included.
